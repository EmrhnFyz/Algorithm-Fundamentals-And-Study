# Algorithm Fundamentals and Study

Welcome to **Algorithm Fundamentals and Study**, a curated collection of core algorithmic patterns and techniques in C++. This repository is designed to help you build a solid foundation, prepare for technical interviews, and develop a strong algorithmic skill set.

## 📚 Overview

This project is organized into eleven major topics, each covering essential algorithms and data structures. For each topic, you will find:

- A **What / When / Why** explanation
- Key takeaways and complexity analysis
- Example problems and solutions in C++
- Practical tips and common pitfalls

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmrhnFyz/algorithm-fundamentals-and-study.git
   cd algorithm-fundamentals-and-study
   ```
### 2. **Browse by topic**:
Each folder corresponds to a major topic. Start with the ones most relevant to your goals.
### 3. **Run examples**:
- **Via IDE**:
  - Open your solution or folder in your chosen IDE (e.g., Rider, VS Code, CLion).
  - Build the project or file and click Run. Your IDE will handle compilation and execution.
- **Via command line:**
  - Navigate to the folder containing the C++ file you want to run.
  - Compile the file using:
    ```bash
    g++ -o output_file_name source_file.cpp
    ```
